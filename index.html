        <p>I am a twenty one year old from Mendota Heights. I am very goal oriented, though I have taken some time to really figure out the career path I want to take. Looking back, it seems like a no-brainer to learn and work in the web development field as technology has been a huge aspect of my life for as long as I can remember. I have always enjoyed exploring and tinkering with technology such as computers, phones and gaming systems. I am motivated to learn about coding since I have learned some basics and that has made me very curious to discover what else I can do with code. </p>

    <p class="indent">This was my first exposure to computer programming. My dad's work offered this class to employees' kids and I signed up becuase it seemed interesting.
    It was an intro class focused around Python. At first I was pretty confused but as the class progressed it became really cool to me and I had a lot of fun. This class was very basic but was a crucial part to my programming journey.</p>

          <p class="indent">After leaving UMD I rediscovered an interest for coding by watching some free tutorials on YouTube which inspired me to take Computer Science 1 at St. Paul College. This class covered the basics of computer history, writing psuedocode, command line, and writing in C. My dedication to this course showed that I really like learning about these concepts and can see myself persuing a career in this field.</p>

        <p class="indent"> I have been taking Angela Yu's 2021 Complete Web Development Bootcamp, which I am about two thirds of the way done with. This course has been an amazing resource for learning the basics of web development. It includes fifity-five hours of instructional videos teaching HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node, React, MongoDB and more. The instructor helps you through a ton of projects that have taught me the basics of building a website. This course has been super fun and challenging which has solidified that I want to become a developer.  </p>
